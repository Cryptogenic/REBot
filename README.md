REBot is a Discord bot programmed in the Golang programming language to provide useful commands to reverse engineers and exploit developers. It provides features such as on-the-fly assembly and disassembly for common (and even less common) architectures, such as x86/64, ARM/AARCH64, PPC, and MIPS. It also provides other features such as a technical dictionary, CVE look-up, and giving tips and tricks on reverse engineering and exploit development practices.

You can join the official REBot to your server using [this discord invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=472921462328524831&permissions=0&scope=bot). REBot doesn't need any special permissions - only text read and send permissions so it can interact with you.

## Getting Started
Below are some instructions on how to get the project building on your machine. I personally built this on Windows 10. The project itself is platform independent - however the way you build and configure keystone and capstone will vary depending on your target system.

### Prerequisites
The following software is required to built and use REBot.
- Golang
- Keystone Assembler Engine
- Capstone Disassembler Engine

### Go Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build the project using Go.
- [bwmarrin/discordgo](http://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
- [go-ini/ini](http://github.com/go-ini/ini)
- [keystone go bindings](http://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/bindings/go/keystone)
- [gapstone - capstone go bindings](http://github.com/bnagy/gapstone)

## Building
### Installing prerequisites
#### Windows
You should install Golang using their official Windows installer provided [here](https://golang.org/dl/). As for Keystone and Capstone, for Windows I recommend that you use the pre-compiled libraries they provide [here](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/releases/download/0.9.1/keystone-0.9.1-win64.zip) (for keystone) and [here](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/releases/download/3.0.5/capstone-3.0.5-win64.zip) (for capstone).

The libraries and header files for Keystone and Capstone should go in dedicated folders, I personally chose `C:\src\keystone` and `C:\src\capstone` respectively. The `.lib` files can be disgarded/deleted/renamed, as if they're present in the folder when you go to build, you may encounter linker errors. The `.dll` file is sufficient.

You may also need to edit the bindings to build the project successfully - changing the `cgo` directives to reflect the directories you setup the libraries in. For Keystone, I edited `go/src/github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/bindings/go/keystone/keystone-binding.go` and set the `cgo` directives to the following:

```golang
//#cgo windows CFLAGS: -IC:/src/keystone/include
//#cgo windows LDFLAGS: -LC:/src/keystone -lkeystone -lstdc++ -lm
```

For Capstone, nearly all the `.go` files for the binding had to be edited for the `cgo` directives. I edited them to the following:

```golang
//#cgo windows CFLAGS: -IC:/src/capstone/include
//#cgo windows LDFLAGS: -LC:/src/capstone -lcapstone
```

#### Linux (Debian)
Firstly, you should install Golang. You can do this via the following commands in the terminal:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```

For Keystone and Capstone, you may have to build the libraries yourself. Follow [Keystone's](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/docs/COMPILE-NIX.md) and [Capstone's](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone/blob/master/COMPILE.TXT) COMPILE instructions for your given system.

### Building the project
Finally, you can build the project by simply running `go build`. You will however need to add your Discord app authentication token to the `config.ini` file - or REBot won't be able to connect to discord.

## Obtaining a Discord bot token
1. Create a bot @ [Discord Development Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Ensure "Message Content Intent" is set to enabled
3. Copy the token from the "Bot" page, and add it to `config.ini`
4. Go to OAuth -> URL Generator
5. Make sure "bot" is checked
6. Give the bot appropriate permissions
7. Copy URL and paste in browser to invite bot to server

## Running REBot as a Docker container
Discord has a limit of how many servers (unverified) bots can join. For unverified bots, the max is 100 servers. REBot is currently unverified and has maxed the number of servers it can be invited to. You can however run the following commands to self-host REBot:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Cryptogenic/REBot.git
$ cd REBot
$ docker compose up -d
```
